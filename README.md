# IEEE-x-E-yantra-4-day-Robotics-Workshop

## AVR Bootloader
	For uploading the hexfile of the arduino code for firebird v robot.
## FaceDetect-master
	For detecting human faces using webcam feed in realtime using python
	with opencv(for computer vision) and numpy(for scitific computing).
## Object	Detection Tracker
	For detecting object using webcam feed in realtime using python with 
	opencv(for computer vision) and numpy(for scitific computing). The 
	camera position is adjusted using two servo motors (for tilt and 
	pan motion) controlled using arduino.
## ObsticalAvoidance 
	Obstical avoidance robot made using SharpIR sensor present in FireBird
	V robot to avoid obstical in its vicinity.
##   SharpIR-Master
	It is a library for using SharpIR sensor in arduino.
## drive
	Code for driving FirdBird V robot in different directions using the 
	provided two DC motors.
## servoCalibration
	Code for calibrating servo motors
## servoCode
	First draft code for pan and tilt motion (didn't ending up using it)
